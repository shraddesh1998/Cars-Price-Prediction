# Cars24-Revenue_Prediction

1. With the help of web scrapping, we managed to get sufficient data. The techniques used were BeautifulSoup,AutoScraper and Selenium, but the extracted data was less.
2. So we used another technique i.e. Web Scraper - Chrome Extension for all the popular cities and extracted the data as per need.
3. Our objective is to build Regression model on sales price of upcoming future cars on cars24 website.
4. We did the Visualization and deployed the model on Streamlit.
